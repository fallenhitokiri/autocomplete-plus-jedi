# autocomplete-plus-jedi - Adding jedi based completions for Python to autocomplete-plus

## Installation
Either use Atoms package manager or `apm install autocomplete-plus-jedi`

## Usage
APJ - let us just call it APJ, that's way shorter - uses the Python interpreter
in your path. If you want to use it with a virtualenv just make sure the env is
active and start atom from the command line.

## Warning
This addon is young, not feature complete and breaks when you use `'''` for
docstrings. But it is under active development, so eventually things will
improve.
